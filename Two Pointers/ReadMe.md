The **Two Pointers** technique is a powerful and efficient approach in algorithm design that **involves using two variables (pointers) to traverse a data structure, usually an array or a linked list**. Instead of using nested loops, two pointers allow you to optimize solutions by reducing time complexity.

**Common Usage:**

**Sorting & Searching Problems** – Like finding pairs that sum to a target (Two Sum problem).

**Palindrome Checking** – Comparing characters from both ends of a string.

**Removing Duplicates in Sorted Arrays** – Keeping track of unique elements efficiently.

**Merging Sorted Arrays** – Moving through two lists simultaneously.

**Partitioning Arrays** – Rearranging elements based on conditions.
