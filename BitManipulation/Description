# Bit Manipulation 

## Overview
This repository contains various programs and solutions related to **Bit Manipulation**. The goal is to demonstrate how bitwise operations can be used to efficiently solve common programming problems. 

Bit manipulation is a powerful tool for optimizing algorithms and reducing time complexity. In this repo, you will find solutions for both basic and advanced bit manipulation techniques.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into different files, each solving a specific bit manipulation problem. Below is an overview of the programs included:

- **find_unique_element.py**: Solves the problem of finding the element that appears only once in an array, where all other elements appear twice.
- **reverse_bits.py**: Reverses the bits of a given integer.
- **count_set_bits.py**: Counts the number of set bits (1's) in a binary number.
- **power_of_two.py**: Checks if a given number is a power of two.
- **is_odd_or_even.py**: Determines if a number is odd or even using bitwise operators.
