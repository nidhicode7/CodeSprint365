## ✨ HASH MAP

-  A HashMap (also called dictionary in Python, or map in Java/C++) is just a data structure that stores key → value pairs.
-  Think of it like a locker system at a gym:
   Every locker has a unique number (key).
   Inside the locker, you can keep any item (value).
- So you can quickly:
  Put something inside (map[key] = value)
  Take it out (map[key])
  Check if a locker exists (key in map)
